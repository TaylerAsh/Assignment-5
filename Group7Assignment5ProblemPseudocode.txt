Assignment 5 Problem 1 pseudocode:

- Open the dictionary file.

- Define a vector of strings called words.

- For each word in the dictionary file

   - Append the word to the words vector.

- Open the file to be checked.

- For each word in that file

- If the word is not contained in the words vector

      Print the word.

Problem 2 pseudocode:

- Ask the user whether they want to encrypt or decrypt.

- Ask the user for a shift value (number of positions to shift letters).

- Read the text from input.txt.

- Apply the Caesar cipher:

	Encryption: shift letters forward by the shift value.

	Decryption: shift letters backward by the shift value.

- Write the result to output.txt.
